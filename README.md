# Motif-finding-project
This is the term project about finding motif in a group of DNA sequences family , which is so important to study the transcription , translation and the relation between genes.   

In this project I implement not only the EM algorithm but also added in some idea by myself derived by the power of boosting.  

For more detail please refer to the report I wrote.
